## GATE Telegram Study Material Collector

This project listens to Telegram channels, fetches historical messages, filters them by keywords, and downloads attached PDF study materials. It also saves collected messages to `messages.json` and can run continuously to capture new posts in real time.

## Features
- Fetch historical messages from one or more Telegram channels
- Filter messages by keywords (e.g., "GATE", "DBMS", "notes")
- Auto-download PDFs and save them to the `downloads/` folder
- Save message metadata to `messages.json`
- Keep a persistent Telegram session in `gate_listener_session.session`

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install telethon
```

2. Run the listener

```powershell
python listener.py
```

Note: On first run you'll be prompted for your phone number and the Telegram login code.

## Configuration
Open `listener.py` and edit the following variables to suit your needs:

- `channels_to_listen` ‚Äî list of channel usernames or IDs, e.g. `['gatecsitstudymaterial']`
- `KEYWORDS` ‚Äî list of keywords to filter messages. Use `[]` to save everything.
- `HISTORICAL_LIMIT` ‚Äî number of past messages to fetch per channel (e.g., `100`).

Example (in `listener.py`):

```python
channels_to_listen = ['gatecsitstudymaterial']
KEYWORDS = ["DBMS", "GATE", "PYQ", "notes", "pdf", "syllabus"]
HISTORICAL_LIMIT = 100
```

## Output / Files
- `messages.json` ‚Äî stored message records and metadata
- `downloads/` ‚Äî folder where PDF files are saved
- `gate_listener_session.session` ‚Äî Telegram session file (keeps you logged in)

Sample saved record:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "channel": "gatecsitstudymaterial",
  "message": "DBMS notes for GATE 2025",
  "pdf_file": "downloads/dbms_notes.pdf",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "type": "historical"
}
```

## Usage notes
- The script fetches historical messages up to `HISTORICAL_LIMIT` and then listens for new messages.
- Stop the listener with Ctrl+C.
- If you want to collect everything, set `KEYWORDS = []`.

## Troubleshooting
- No messages? Make sure your account has joined the channel(s) you want to read.
- PDFs not downloading: check internet access and file permissions for the `downloads/` folder.
- Login problems: delete `gate_listener_session.session` and re-run to re-authenticate.

## Safety & Privacy
- The script uses your Telegram account to access channels you have access to. Do not share `gate_listener_session.session`.

## Next steps / Improvements
- Add command-line arguments for channels, keywords and limits.
- Add logging and retry logic for failed downloads.
- Add unit tests for message parsing and filtering.
